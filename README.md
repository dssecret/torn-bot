# torn-bot

torn-bot is a Discord bot for [Torn City](https://www.torn.com) using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) module.

## Installation

Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then set the config file manually or run 
`__init__.py`. Once the bot is run, if the config file does not exist on startup, Python will ask for the Bot Token. 
Then use the commands to set up other tokens, keys, channels, and roles.

## Usage

To run the bot, run the `__init__.py` file after installing the required modules.
